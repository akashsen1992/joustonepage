  <h2>Privacy Policy for JOUST WEB</h2>
  <p>Joust holding Private Limited (“Joust,” “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared
    this <a href="#/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined
    below) we collect from users of our website, located at https://www.bestoust.co(the “Site”) and online services
    (collectively, the “Service”).</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Types of Data We Collect. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including,
      for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information
      about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous Data” means data, including
      aggregated and de-identified data, that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data
      does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data,
      as described below.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Information You Provide Us.</li>
      <ol>
        <li>We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, e-mail and mailing addresses,
          Ethereum address, and Joust password when you create an account to log in to our network (“Account”).</li>
        <li>If you use our Services on your mobile device, we may collect your phone number and the unique device id
          number.</li>
        <li>Our Service lets you store preferences like how your content is displayed, your location, safe search
          settings, notification settings, and favorite widgets. We may associate these choices with your ID, browser or
          mobile device, and you can edit these preferences at any time.</li>
        <li>When connecting to our Services via a service provider that uniquely identifies your mobile device, we may
          receive this identification and use it to offer extended services and/or functionality.</li>
        <li>Certain Services, such as two-factor authentication, may require our collection of your phone number. We may
          associate that phone number to your mobile device identification information.</li>
        <li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as
          any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply.</li>
        <li>We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating
          system and version, product registration number, Ethereum address, and other requested information if you
          contact us via email regarding support for the Services.</li>
        <li>We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Service that state that Personal Data is being
          collected.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Information Collected via Technology. As you navigate through and interact with our Service, we may use
        automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions and
        patterns, including:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Information Collected by Our Servers. To make our Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be
          hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating
          system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you
          use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, Ethereum address, wallet type, and/or
          a date/time stamp for your visit.</li>
        <li>Log Files. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log
          files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit
          pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends,
          administer the Service, track users’ movements around the Service, gather demographic information about our
          user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information
          may be collected so that when you visit the Service, it will recognize you and the information could then be
          used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests</li>
        <li>Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “Cookies” are small pieces of
          information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use
          both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your
          computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Service.
          This type of information is collected to make the Service more useful to you and to tailor the experience with
          us to meet your special interests and needs.</li>
        <li>Pixel Tag. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags'' (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).
          Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to
          track online movements of Web users. In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive,
          Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages. Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format
          users can read, and they tell us whether emails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages
          that are of interest to our users. We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.
          We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.</li>
        <li>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals. We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals or other
          mechanisms that might enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site.</li>
        <li>Analytics Services. In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own
          cookies or similar tools when you visit our Service. This includes third party analytics services, including
          but not limited to Google Analytics (“Analytics Services”), that we engage to help analyze how users use the
          Service. We may receive reports based on these parties’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate
          basis. We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Service. The information
          generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Service (the “Analytics Information”) is
          transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on
          user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so
          by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Services’
          ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’ Terms of Use and <a
            href="#/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. By using our Service, you consent to the processing of data about you
          by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of Analytics Services,
          please contact us at the address given in paragraph (1).</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Information Collected from Third Party Companies. We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about you from
        companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer
        their products and/or services on our Service. In particular, MetaMask and other wallets provide us with your
        Ethereum address and certain other information you choose to share with MetaMask and other wallets. These third
        party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this to the information we have already collected
        from you via our Service in order to improve it. We do not collect Personal Data automatically, but we may tie
        the information that we collect automatically to Personal Data about you that we collect from other sources or
        that you provide to us.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Use of Your Personal Data</li>
